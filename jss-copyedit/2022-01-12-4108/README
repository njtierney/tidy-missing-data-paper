Dear Nick, 

Many thanks for your reply and updates. Before sending it to publishing,
I would appreciate if you could address the following points :

- please add a sentence to the paper similar to:
"Package  \pkg{naniar} \citep{pkg:naniar} is available from the Comprehensive \proglang{R}
Archive Network (CRAN) at \url{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=naniar}."

> This has now been added at the end of the abstract and also in the second last paragraph of the introduction

- Discrepancies in Figure 2: Thanks for the clarification.
If the missing is added randomly, we would like to ask you to set a seed, such that the results are 
_exactly_ reproducible (please update the results in the paper accordingly).

> A seed has now been set for this

- Discrepancies Figure 15/16 (knn): Would you know where this discrepancies are stemming from. We do aim that, if possible the results are exactly reproducible. 
[Ainesh] Check in re-run of Ainesh

> I have added a seed in the relevant parts of the knn imputation parts of the model, I believe that this resolves this issue.

- Please also add an email address in the affilation.

> This has now been added



Many thanks. Best, 
Sandra
